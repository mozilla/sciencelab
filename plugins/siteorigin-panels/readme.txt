Build responsive page layouts using the widgets you know and love using this simple drag and drop page builder.

== Description ==

[vimeo http://vimeo.com/59561067]

WordPress has evolved into a fully functional CMS. Page Builder (previously called Panels) completes the transition by giving you a way to create responsive column layouts using the widgets you know and love.

[Our newsletter](http://siteorigin.com/) is a great place to stay up to date with Page Builder and the rest of our free WordPress products.

= Use Your Widgets =

You know widgets. They're the things you add to your sidebars. Page Builder makes all your widgets even more useful by turning them into the building blocks of your pages.

We've included a few useful widgets, but it works with a lot of other well made widgets and plugins out there.

= Works with Most Themes =

Page Builder works with most well made themes. The only requirement is that your theme supports pages. And if your theme is responsive, change a few settings and boom, your layouts will work with your theme and collapse into a single column on mobile devices.

There are loads free and premium themes that work with the Page Builder, we have our own collection of [free themes](http://siteorigin.com/) if you'd like to use one of ours.

= Bundled Widgets =

To get you started, we've include a few widgets:

* Gallery widget for inserting image galleries.
* Image widget for inserting standard images.
* Self hosted video widget for embedding your own videos.
* Post Loop to display a list of posts. This requires that your theme supports it.

As well as some essential page elements widgets:

* Button
* Call to Action
* List
* Price Box
* Animated Image
* Testimonial

= 3rd Party Widgets =

Most standard widgets work with Page Builder, but here are some of our favorites.

* [Black Studio TinyMCE](http://wordpress.org/plugins/black-studio-tinymce-widget/) for a visual content editing widget.
* [Meta Slider](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ml-slider/) for a responsive slider widget.

[Contact me](mailto:greg@siteorigin.com) if you've created a widget that would work well with Page Builder so I can add it to our recommended plugins list. Your plugin will also be recommended within Page Builder itself.

== Installation ==

1. Upload and install Page Builder in the same way you'd install any other plugin.
2. Read the [usage documentation](http://siteorigin.com/page-builder/documentation/) on SiteOrigin.

== Screenshots ==

1. The page builder interface.
2. Adding a new widget. This includes a live search filter to help you keep control if you have a lot of widgets.
3. Editing a widget's settings.
4. Easily undo mistakes.

== Documentation ==

[Documentation](http://siteorigin.com/page-builder/documentation/) is available on SiteOrigin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I bundle Page Builder with my theme? =

Yes, provided your theme is licensed under GPL or a compatible license. If you're publishing your theme on ThemeForest, you must select the GPL license instead of their regular license.

Page Builder is actively developed and updated, so generally I'd recommend that you have your users install the actual plugin so they can receive updates. You can try [TGM Plugin Activation](http://tgmpluginactivation.com/).

= Will plugin X work with Page Builder? =

I've tried to ensure that Page Builder is compatible with most plugin widgets. It's best to just download Page Builder and test for yourself.
